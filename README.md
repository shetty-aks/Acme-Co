# Welcome to ACME CO.

## Summary

This is a fictitious website using Next.js framework. As far as now I have worked on the following -

### Level 1 - Next.js setup with typescript and basic page layout

-   Create Next.js instance
-   Use typescript
-   Create React components for sections of the webpage, you do not need to style these components but the markup should be well thought out.
-   Use yarn to setup the build process
-   Provide documentation on how to get it running locally

Stay tuned for more updates in coming week!

## Steps to get it running locally

### Requirements

-   Node.js and yarn

### Steps to run it locally
```
git clone https://github.com/shetty-aks/FrontendChallenge.git
cd FrontendChallenge/acme-co
yarn install
```
Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```
yarn dev
```

Open  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)  with a browser of your choice and you should see a landing page as shown in the demo. Take a note of the fact that, Next JS needs to take some time to compile the project for your first time.
